Yet an other place for solutions of various algorithmic nature practice problems from 
various sources:
  hackerrank.com
  spoj.com
  codeforces.com
  usaco.org
  hellenico.gr
  
The initial intension for this project was to store some of my solutions and maybe help beginner or intermediate 
level contestants that are stuck on some of these problems.  

Not all solutions have detailed documentation.
There is no guaranty for the 100% validity of code or that no more optimization is required.
